    "- 'player1_PER' and 'Player2_PER' are the top 2 negative coefficients. This is incredibly suprising and does not make much sense to me. One would think that the players who play the most minutes would want to have a higher efficiency rating. Perhaps that teams who had their top players with very high PER caused the rest of their team to have very low PER. The top players are important, but it is still a team game and everyone needs to contribute. I am going to run more models and see if this is a trend. \n",
    "- Coaches seem very important. There are a number of coaches in both the top and bottom coefficients indicating that some coaches seem to make the playoffs very often, and some rarely make the playoffs. \n",
    "- The top 3 positive coefficients make sense. They are key statistics of players in the top 5 of their respective team. This is what I would expect. A lot of teams have 1 or 2 players that are very good. It is when you can add that 3rd player that a team really elevates. \n",
    "- If I was consulting an NBA executive, I would encourage them to hire Dave Joerger as he is an assistant coach, and most likely available for a head coaching job. There are other coached with high coefficients. If a team is looking for a new coach, this is a great way to make a short list and interview those coaches that seem to impact winning. "

It also makes sense becasue there are other factors on offense that influence a teams offensive production. For example, if a team is getting offensive rebounds at a high rate, this could bring down there shooting percentage, but bring up there overall offensive production. "

    " ### Conclusion\n",
    " \n",
    " I feel that because my data set is not too large, the best model is the one that includes all of the features. The coefficients make more sense and give back some actionable insights. Here are my key recomendations to NBA executives. \n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Coaches matter. Across all modeling coaches were a huge factor. We can use this data to make a short list of coaches that have the biggest impact on winning and then target those coaches. \n",
    " 2. Offense Rules. ORtg and Rel ORtg are the top 2 positive coefficients in the best model. This furthers the notion that it is an offensive league and teams cannot rely on strong defense to win. in order to be sucessful, offense should be the number one priority. Instead of going after players who are defensive minded, focus on those players that have a history of being pruductive on offense.\n",
    " 3. The top 3 players are incredibly important and they must have a high PER. player3_PER didnt make the top 10 positive coefficients, but it was number 13. This tells us that the third player is incredibly important. A lot of teams have 1 or 2 great players. Adding that third player is a major key to success.\n",
    " 4. Pace: It is important, but do not let it rule your philosophy. I got mixed results in determining if this was a big factor. I suspect that depending on the make up of your team, this could have a positive or negative impact. My recomendation is to hire a coach with a good track record, and let him decide how much emphasis to put on pace. "
